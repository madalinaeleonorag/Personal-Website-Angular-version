        text: `Hi Madalina,<br>
        Please find below my feedback for you. The feedback is based on my interaction with you, as well as feedback I have received from various Alpha stakeholders (UK and ERDC).<br>
        During her time spent on Alpha space, Madalina has shown a lot of flexibility and maturity.<br>
        Even though she had to change teams and industries, from banking to insurance, her experience has been extremely appreciate by our main stakeholders and there have been multiple requests to keep her on Alpha.
        From a technical perspective, she delivers extremely fast and at a high quality. For example, she managed to bring visible improvements on the web app in just a couple of weeks, as well as mentioning more junior team members. If given the opportunity (to match her expertise and role desired), she has the ability to make a huge  difference, she has the skills and determination needed. For that, she has my respect and support through her career path, here in Digital.
        <br>
        As a future recommendation, I would probably suggest Madalina to socialise and interact with her team more. I fully understand it can be challenging to adapt to a new company, environment, team but sometimes, all you need to do is open yourself a little bit, and let your colleagues get closer to you.
        Note: The above suggest is based on my personal experience from a while back. It\'s up to Madalina to analyse and decide if it was just a context issue or if she thinks there is room to improve as I\'m not that close to her day to day activity.
        <br>
        Thanks,
        Isabela`,

        I have been working with Madalina for almost two months on Alpha for Insurance core project. Even though the collaboration was for a short while as the project could not afford extra costs at this time, she managed to leave a very strong impression. She gave a huge boost to our Web app development, she came with a very long list of improvements to our existing app and managed to implement a lot of those items in just a couple of weeks: upgrade Angular from ver 8 up to ver 13, brought in good practices like introducing a vocabulary into the app, introducing CSS constants, introducing model classes, refactoring a lot of components to make them more reusable, adjust tons of pieces of layout to make them more responsive, updating and eliminating redundant dependencies, etc. She is mastering SASS, she is extremely fast at delivering very appealing layouts with very well structured CSS code. The quality of the code she has been writing and the overall work quality has been impressive. She delivered a lot of features in a very short time, at the highest standards. She is hard working and determined to deliver good quality work. For Web developer Consultant level she is a top performer. I hope to work with Madalina soon. I would always want her in my team, given the opportunity.<br>
        Thank you for your hard work and for the huge improvements to our app, Madalina!`,

Without doubt I can say that she had a big impact on me. She\'s ambitious, enjoys learning new things all the time, she takes action whenever the situation requires it.She never stepped back from a challenge, but rather is determined to figure out how we overcome it.Madalina was there when anyone from the team needed support on any level: if it\'s a coding problem, providing some information, investigating an issue, giving an advice non-work related or just for a simple talk. She always encourages everyone to push their limits and become a better version on themselves. Her patient and professional attitude makes it really easy to talk to. She\'s not just about work, she\'s also about being human and having a good time while trying to grow as much as possible.',
